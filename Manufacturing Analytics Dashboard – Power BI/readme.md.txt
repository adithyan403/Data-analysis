## 🏭 Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

This project simulates a real-world manufacturing scenario inspired by Tata Steel’s multi-plant operations.

Using a generated dataset, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes:
- Plant-wise production and dispatch
- Inventory tracking by product
- Regional dispatch performance
- Revenue trends and KPIs using DAX

📌 **Note**: This project uses **simulated data inspired by real manufacturing operations**. It is not affiliated with or based on any confidential or proprietary data from Tata Steel or any other organization.

🔧 Tools: Power BI, DAX, Slicers, Line/Bar/Donut Charts  
📁 Files: `tata_steel_analysis.pbix`, `TataSteel_OperationsData.csv`
