# 🔍 Data Analysis Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my data analysis and business intelligence projects using **Power BI**, **SQL (SSMS)**, and **Python (Google Colab)**.  
Each project reflects real-world scenarios and is structured to demonstrate end-to-end skills — from data cleaning to dashboarding to machine learning.

### 💾 2. SQL Sales Analytics – SSMS
- Built `Customers` and `Orders` tables in SQL Server
- Wrote complex SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregations
- Created reports for customer-wise and product-wise revenue, order count by country, and top customer spenders  
🔗 *Files*: `customer_orders_schema.sql`, `revenue_report.sql`
